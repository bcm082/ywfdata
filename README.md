## Step 1: Install Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing you to run JavaScript on the server-side.

- Download Node.js: Go to the official Node.js website and download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for your operating system.
- Install Node.js: Run the installer and follow the prompts. The default settings should be fine for most users.
- Verify Installation: Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following commands to check if Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) were installed successfully:
```
node -v
npm -v
```
You should see the version numbers of Node.js and npm, respectively.

## Step 2: Install MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. There are multiple ways to use MongoDB for development, including installing it locally or using MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based service.

- Local Installation: You can download MongoDB from the official site and follow the installation guide for your operating system.
- MongoDB Atlas: Alternatively, you can use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-hosted MongoDB service. Sign up for a free account, create a cluster, and connect to it from your application. This method avoids local installation and is great for beginners.

## Step 3: Install Docker
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow you to package your application with all of its dependencies into a single unit.

- Download Docker: Visit the Docker website and download Docker Desktop for your operating system.
- Install Docker: Run the downloaded installer and follow the instructions.
- Verify Installation: Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to check if Docker was installed successfully:
```
docker --version
```

You should see the Docker version number.
